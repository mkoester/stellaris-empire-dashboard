[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Companion mod 0.2.0 (log format 2): the stockpile every day, shown live in the resources panel
  and between months in the stockpile chart; the exact save you loaded, so a reload's branch is no
  longer a guess; colonies, wars, leader deaths, new rulers and space battles at the day they
  happen, on the events page and in the charts. The dashboard still reads the 0.1.0 mod's lines.
- Cleaning up: the config tab lists the games in the history, each can be deleted; a game whose
  saves are all gone from disk is offered for deletion once.

- A resources tab: per resource a chart of its stockpile and its net per month, and a table of
  what earns and spends it each month, source by source (ships, jobs, buildings, the market, …).

- A download for macOS (13.5 or newer), for Apple silicon and Intel Macs, with its own Python.
- Every folder the dashboard looks in, per system and store, listed in the zip's `README.txt`.

### Changed

- A start reads only the game played last (the first start: the one with the newest save); the
  other games catch up in the background a few seconds later, the most recently played first.
- The history is upgraded in place when a new version changes its tables, after a copy beside it
  (`dashboard.v15.sqlite`). An older version started by mistake refuses a newer history instead
  of discarding it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-20

First public release.

### Added

- Reads the game's autosaves as they are written and keeps their history in a save graph: loading
  an older save starts a new branch instead of overwriting history.
- Tabs for the empire overview with history graphs, colonies (pros and cons, problems), a single
  colony, the discovered galaxy map, migration, expansion and habitat sites, trade deals, the
  market, events, government (council, agendas, policies, edicts, factions), situations, the
  Shroud, empire focus, traditions, tech, leaders, species, contacts, megastructures, mods and DLC.
- Profiles with custom tabs; light and dark theme.
- Downloads for Windows and Linux that bring their own runtime: start, pick the game folders
  (found automatically for Steam, GOG, Microsoft Store, Linux native and Proton), play.
- Game data read from your own installation once per game version and DLC set.
